# UFOs

## Overview

For this project we were tasked with updating our dynamic webpage to include more search filters. This would allow users to be able to refine the UFO data with filters for multiple criteria at the same time.

## Results

### UFO Sightings webpage

The webpage is available at [https://tmidcalf.github.io/UFOs/](https://tmidcalf.github.io/UFOs/).

### Webpage Search Criteria

The initial page and blank search criteria looks like the image below.

To refine the search and filter the data, any user can input a date, city, state, country, or shape, or any combination of the filters into the corresponding text boxes and press enter on their keyboard. The table will then update with results of the inputted search criteria.

For example, if a user wants to know all the triangle shaped UFO sightings in California they would type "CA" into the State text box and "triangle" into the shape text box. The resulting table would look like the following image.

## Summary

- One drawback of the design would be that it is kind of difficult for the user to know what search parameters will return results. The user would need to look through the table to see what cities and countries are even on the table to narrow the search.

- One recommendation I would include to filter the search and solve the problem of our drawback would to include a drop down menu with the available cities, countries, and shapes. 
  
- Another recommendation I would make would be to allow multiple results. Such as a slider for the date criteria so the user could look at a range of dates instead of just one.
